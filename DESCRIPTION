Chapter: Chapter 5A - Probability
Description: This app is focused on exploring bivariate continuous distributions and their joint, marginal, and conditional probability density functions.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to understand how the joint and marginal PDF graphs compare within bivariate continuous distributions.",
    "The student will learn how and why to condition variables in bivariate continuous distributions.",
    "The student will learn how parameter adjustments affect independence between variables."
